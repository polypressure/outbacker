# Outbacker Examples

Quick examples of how to use Outbacker. Please look at them in this order:

1. A [controller](https://github.com/polypressure/outbacker/blob/master/examples/app/controllers/appointments_controller.rb) that uses Outbacker.
1. A [business logic PORO](https://github.com/polypressure/outbacker/blob/master/examples/app/domain/appointment_calendar.rb) that uses Outbacker.
1. A [controller test using OutbackerStub](https://github.com/polypressure/outbacker/blob/master/examples/test/controllers/appointments_controller_test.rb) to "stub" outcomes.
1. The Outbacker [gem initializer file](https://github.com/polypressure/outbacker/blob/master/examples/config/initializers/outbacker.rb), to configure your policy specifying where the Outbacker module can be included.

If you need more details, you can go back to the main [ README](https://github.com/polypressure/outbacker/blob/master/README.md) file.
